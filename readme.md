# NekkoPlat

This is a simple platformer engine(?) that I'm making for fun. It's not really a game, but more of a tool to make games. It's written in Javascript, with the intent that you can make levels and games with no to minimal javascript! Not only that, but it should be easy to convert most webpages into a level for this engine.

This project has evolved from a project for fun, to a project for fun and practice! I've rewritten everything to be more modular/object oriented to make continued development easier!
